What is used in this class but doesnt add any value?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color 
  end

  def self.information
    return "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a colour of green"
  end

end

#The return in the information method is unnecessary.
